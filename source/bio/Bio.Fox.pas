Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
hey dushan!
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:

dusanc says:
Hah I've got msn to work
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
sweet
dusanc says:
Well it took me 2 weeks
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
how r u
dusanc says:
If you want to use ICQ MSN etc. good client is trillian
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
yeah
dusanc says:
I'm great
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
trillian keeps crashing my computer  
dusanc says:
Well I'll see how it does for me
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
im just making a IsPrey and IsPredator function for all creature
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
so
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
Fox would be true for Predator
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
Rabbit would be true for Prey
dusanc says:
Thats great
dusanc says:
How would you solve fight
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
whoever Grabs the first
dusanc says:
Maybe there should be diiferent energy cost 
dusanc says:
eg. for a Trex and ant
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
true
dusanc says:
And did you solve multiple attachments to one creature
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
no
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
well
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i know how to do it... but im too lazy  
dusanc says:
true
dusanc says:
 
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i was thinking
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
to make a "string" attachment
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
if the string gets too long, it breaks
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
when an object moves, the string "tenses" and drags the attached object
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
it took me so long to make the attachments work
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
im too scared to change it
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
the DNA thing is going great
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i am making Fox and Rabbit into genetic creature
dusanc says:
well I'm still not satisfied with it
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i want you to help, make them have energy etc
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
see... with the birds and fish and ducks... i dont want to change them
dusanc says:
Just wanted to say that
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
with fox and rabbits, they need lots of improvement
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
so you can go nuts and change them if you want  
dusanc says:
well thats why I was making you to
dusanc says:
make dna code universal
dusanc says:
so we wouldn't need
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
yeah
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but
dusanc says:
to recompile everything
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
then that gives me alot of work to do  
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i hate work
dusanc says:
hah
dusanc says:
I didn't understood you 
dusanc says:
wwait
dusanc says:
could you explain to me
dusanc says:
why there could'nt be
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i want to keep Birds, Fish, Ducks the same.  then, the GeneticCreature would evolve to be better than them
dusanc says:
an array?? of  values in some file
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
all the values in the file, must be hardcoded into the creature
dusanc says:
ok you're the boss
dusanc says:
but there's a catch
dusanc says:
I would have to learn delphi/pascal from the beggining
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
true
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
 
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
you should learn, its fun
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i learnt while i worked at a company.  but it took my only 1 month
dusanc says:
yeh right but I have my exams
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
ah school
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
true
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i am finished school, so i have free time  
dusanc says:
ah faculty of mechanical engineering
dusanc says:
so I don't have time
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
thats ok
dusanc says:
but i'll try
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
your ideas are very helpful
dusanc says:
well if you'd see what we learn
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
for example your fox.ini and rabbit.ini, I'm using them
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
there are alot of limits to delphi
dusanc says:
like?
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
your ideas make alot of sense, but i dont know if you realize the amount of work to do them
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
im just 1 guy  
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
delphi doesnt have multiple inheritance
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
and it has no method to access object attributes arbitrarily
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
also... the LearningCreature is extremely slow, to look for the 5 nearest objects
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i dont know how to solve that problem
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i dont know how to make it faster
dusanc says:
what slows it?
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
because when there are 1000 objects... it does a Square Root value on all of them
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
to find the distance
dusanc says:
well you could avoid it a little
dusanc says:
like this
dusanc says:
just to look at the creatures in it's range of sight
dusanc says:
but not to recalculate their distance right away
dusanc says:
but to say
dusanc says:
if range=10
dusanc says:
look only at creatures with
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
hehe... but no matter what.. you have to check all 1000 objects
dusanc says:
x-x1<10
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
because. there is no way to tell what object is what
dusanc says:
y-y1<10
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
yeah
dusanc says:
h-h1<10
dusanc says:
so you would'nt have to recalculate sqr
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
that actually goes the same speed as sqrt, if you have a Floating point processor, the sqrt isnt expensive
dusanc says:
OK
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
its not really the sqrt, just the fact that many objects are checked
dusanc says:
what if you make something like 
dusanc says:
that each creature is in some area(those squares)
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
yes
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
that is a possible solution too
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i tried that
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i kept a list of everything in each square
dusanc says:
i sense it went bad
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but when many objects are moving fast about the squares... it is constantly updating whats in each square... it slows things down a bit
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
it works good when objects dont move
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
hmm
dusanc says:
?
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
just wondering if i should put that back in
dusanc says:
well it shouldn't be too precise
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but im afraid of adding stuff that will crash
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
because its so close to v1.0
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i want to finish 1.0 at end of august
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
after that, i want to make major changes
dusanc says:
like
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
oh i have so many dreams...
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i want to make the planet true 3d
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
and use much better physics
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
collisions
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
rotation (ODE)
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
have buildable structures
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
make objects very "modifiable"
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
all the creatures have energy, DNA
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
and senses
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
since i have been working on aiplanet for almost 1 year now, i want to make version 1.0
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
otherwise, i will go insane  
dusanc says:
ODE is great but how much do myou now about that? energy takes lot of calculations. I don't know
dusanc says:
maybe you already are?
dusanc says:
 
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i have tried using ODE for aiplanet.  but it is a problem for 1000 objects
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
also, buoyancy with ODE.. looks very real... but very expensive
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
ODE has the BEST collision detection
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
and... ODE doesnt really let me stack cubes into structures
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
because i want AI "people" to build house out of blocks
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
have you tried GoalBot
dusanc says:
well i really thought that we should make more robust creatures
dusanc says:
well i looked  at it a litle
dusanc says:
but i'm low on time
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
thats ok... in goalbot u can stack cubes to make a castle, then blow it up
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
we will make more robust creature
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
starting with fox and rabbit  
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
see... it has to be proven with one or two creatures first
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
if they work, then we can apply the change to more
dusanc says:
you type faster than i can reply
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
thats because i drank coffee
dusanc says:
hey if you could open 
dusanc says:
fox.ini
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
ok
dusanc says:
so  if you look well
dusanc says:
if we implement half of that inside
dusanc says:
it'll be great
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
yes
dusanc says:
but i wanted to talk
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i wont implement Desire at first... because the AI cannot quite handle that yet
dusanc says:
to you about some
dusanc says:
desire?
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
desiremate, desirewander etc
dusanc says:
but how will creatures work
dusanc says:
what will make them
dusanc says:
God? (you)
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
yes
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
the ai code is too hard to write
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i wish i could make it better
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
its hard to debug
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
but
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
after we get the rest finish, desire is next
dusanc says:
well i thought that desires shoul be in a way which one is the greatest that goes
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
maybe
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
DesireForMoreFood = x
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
where X is the health, if Health goes below X, it starts to look for food
dusanc says:
no
dusanc says:
you saw in my posts
dusanc says:
something like
dusanc says:
well mostly i want to get rid of god
dusanc says:
in ai planet so
dusanc says:
 i don't want to put
dusanc says:
some artificial boundaries
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
i know what you mean... but its hard
dusanc says:
which would be that value below x
dusanc says:
well let me explain
dusanc says:
you see if we would have max health for a creature
dusanc says:
desire toeat=1-health/maxhealth
dusanc says:
so we would have something like desire toeat=0,654
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
so the desire with highest value, is the desire to do
dusanc says:
YEAH
dusanc says:
all the desires(well most) would be calculated
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
ok
dusanc says:
other would be in dna
dusanc says:
or even better
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
ahh, so if desire to eat gets low, then desire to mate kicks in
dusanc says:
in dna would be a factor HowMuchDoILikeToEat
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
so desireToEat = DNA.DesireToEat * (Health)/MaxHealth
dusanc says:
so desireToEat = DNA.DesireToEat *[1- (Health)/MaxHealth]
Dave (volunteer human guinea pig) says:
ah ok
dusanc says:
we would like >1
dusanc says:
%
}

end.
