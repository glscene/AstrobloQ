   * @brief A date and time used for astronomical calculations.
   *
   * This type is of fundamental importance to Astronomy Engine.
   * It is used to represent dates and times for all astronomical calculations.
   * It is also included in the values returned by many Astronomy Engine functions.
   *
   * To create a valid astro_time_t value from scratch, call #Astronomy_MakeTime
   * (for a given calendar date and time) or #Astronomy_CurrentTime (for the system's
   * current date and time).
   *
   * To adjust an existing astro_time_t by a certain real number of days,
   * call #Astronomy_AddDays.
   *
   * The astro_time_t type contains `ut` to represent Universal Time (UT1/UTC) and
   * `tt` to represent Terrestrial Time (TT, also known as *ephemeris time* ).
   * The difference `tt-ut` is known as *&Delta;T*, using a best-fit piecewise model devised by
   * [Espenak and Meeus](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/deltatpoly2004.html).
   *
   * Both `tt` and `ut` are necessary for performing different astronomical calculations.
   * Indeed, certain calculations (such as rise/set times) require both time scales.
   * See the documentation for the `ut` and `tt` fields for more detailed information.
   *
   * In cases where `astro_time_t` is included in a structure returned by
   * a function that can fail, the `astro_status_t` field `status` will contain a value
   * other than `ASTRO_SUCCESS`; in that case the `ut` and `tt` will hold `NAN` (not a number).
   * In general, when there is an error code stored in a struct field `status`, the
   * caller should ignore all other values in that structure, including the `ut` and `tt`
   * inside `astro_time_t`.
   *)

     * @brief   UT1/UTC number of days since noon on January 1, 2000.
     *
     * The floating point number of days of Universal Time since noon UTC January 1, 2000.
     * Astronomy Engine approximates UTC and UT1 as being the same thing, although they are
     * not exactly equivalent; UTC and UT1 can disagree by up to &plusmn;0.9 seconds.
     * This approximation is sufficient for the accuracy requirements of Astronomy Engine.
     *
     * Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) is the international standard for legal and civil
     * timekeeping and replaces the older Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) standard.
     * UTC is kept in sync with unpredictable observed changes in the Earth's rotation
     * by occasionally adding leap seconds as needed.
     *
     * UT1 is an idealized time scale based on observed rotation of the Earth, which
     * gradually slows down in an unpredictable way over time, due to tidal drag by the Moon and Sun,
     * large scale weather events like hurricanes, and internal seismic and convection effects.
     * Conceptually, UT1 drifts from atomic time continuously and erratically, whereas UTC
     * is adjusted by a scheduled whole number of leap seconds as needed.
     *
     * The value in `ut` is appropriate for any calculation involving the Earth's rotation,
     * such as calculating rise/set times, culumination, and anything involving apparent
     * sidereal time.
     *
     * Before the era of atomic timekeeping, days based on the Earth's rotation
     * were often known as *mean solar days*.

     * @brief   Terrestrial Time days since noon on January 1, 2000.
     *
     * Terrestrial Time is an atomic time scale defined as a number of days since noon on January 1, 2000.
     * In this system, days are not based on Earth rotations, but instead by
     * the number of elapsed [SI seconds](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html)
     * divided by 86400. Unlike `ut`, `tt` increases uniformly without adjustments
     * for changes in the Earth's rotation.
     *
     * The value in `tt` is used for calculations of movements not involving the Earth's rotation,
     * such as the orbits of planets around the Sun, or the Moon around the Earth.
     *
     * Historically, Terrestrial Time has also been known by the term *Ephemeris Time* (ET).

   * The `context` points to some data whose type varies depending on the callback function.
   * It can contain any auxiliary parameters (other than time) needed to evaluate the function.
   * For example, a function may pertain to a specific celestial body, in which case `context`
   * may point to a value of type astro_body_t. The `context` parameter is supplied by
   * the caller of #Astronomy_Search, which passes it along to every call to the callback function.
   * If the caller of `Astronomy_Search` knows that the callback function does not need a context,

   *
   * When a lunar eclipse is found, it is classified as penumbral, partial, or total.
   * Penumbral eclipses are difficult to observe, because the Moon is only slightly dimmed
   * by the Earth's penumbra; no part of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
   * Partial eclipses occur when part, but not all, of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
   * Total eclipses occur when the entire Moon passes into the Earth's umbra.
   *
   * The `kind` field thus holds `ECLIPSE_PENUMBRAL`, `ECLIPSE_PARTIAL`, or `ECLIPSE_TOTAL`,
   * depending on the kind of lunar eclipse found.
   *
   * The `obscuration` field holds a value in the range [0, 1] that indicates what fraction
   * of the Moon's apparent disc area is covered by the Earth's umbra at the eclipse's peak.
   * This indicates how dark the peak eclipse appears. For penumbral eclipses, the obscuration
   * is 0, because the Moon does not pass through the Earth's umbra. For partial eclipses,
   * the obscuration is somewhere between 0 and 1. For total lunar eclipses, the obscuration is 1.
   *
   * Field `peak` holds the date and time of the center of the eclipse, when it is at its peak.
   *
   * Fields `sd_penum`, `sd_partial`, and `sd_total` hold the semi-duration of each phase
   * of the eclipse, which is half of the amount of time the eclipse spends in each
   * phase (expressed in minutes), or 0 if the eclipse never reaches that phase.

   *
   * The eclipse is classified as partial, annular, or total, depending on the
   * maximum amount of the Sun's disc obscured, as seen at the peak location
   * on the surface of the Earth.
   *
   * The `kind` field thus holds `ECLIPSE_PARTIAL`, `ECLIPSE_ANNULAR`, or `ECLIPSE_TOTAL`.
   * A total eclipse is when the peak observer sees the Sun completely blocked by the Moon.
   * An annular eclipse is like a total eclipse, but the Moon is too far from the Earth's surface
   * to completely block the Sun; instead, the Sun takes on a ring-shaped appearance.
   * A partial eclipse is when the Moon blocks part of the Sun's disc, but nobody on the Earth
   * observes either a total or annular eclipse.
   *
   * If `kind` is `ECLIPSE_TOTAL` or `ECLIPSE_ANNULAR`, the `latitude` and `longitude`
   * fields give the geographic coordinates of the center of the Moon's shadow projected

   * at the darkest time `peak`. The value will always be 1 for total eclipses, and less than

   * The `obscuration` field reports what fraction of the Sun's disc appears blocked

   * This is a value that ranges from 0 (no blockage) to 1 (total eclipse).
   * The obscuration value will be between 0 and 1 for partial eclipses and annular eclipses.
   * The value will be exactly 1 for total eclipses. Obscuration gives an indication

   * @brief Information about a body's rotation axis at a given time.
   *
   * This structure is returned by #Astronomy_RotationAxis to report
   * the orientation of a body's rotation axis at a given moment in time.
   * The axis is specified by the direction in space that the body's north pole
   * points, using angular equatorial coordinates in the J2000 system (EQJ).
   *
   * Thus `ra` is the right ascension, and `dec` is the declination, of the
   * body's north pole vector at the given moment in time. The north pole
   * of a body is defined as the pole that lies on the north side of the
   * [Solar System's invariable plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane),
   * regardless of the body's direction of rotation.
   *
   * The `spin` field indicates the angular position of a prime meridian
   * arbitrarily recommended for the body by the International Astronomical
   * Union (IAU).
   *
   * The fields `ra`, `dec`, and `spin` correspond to the variables
   * О±0, Оґ0, and W, respectively, from
   * [Report of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements: 2015](https://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/download/Docs/WGCCRE/WGCCRE2015reprint.pdf).
   *
   * The field `north` is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the body's north pole.
   * It is expressed in the equatorial J2000 system (EQJ).
